This repository contains a Hack code example that demonstrates a runtime error when adding a null value to an integer.  The error arises from the attempt to perform arithmetic operation on a null value.  The solution demonstrates the correct way to handle null values using the null coalescing operator (??). The bug and solution are in separate files for easy comparison.
